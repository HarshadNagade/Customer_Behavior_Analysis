🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Inspected data structure, types, and missing values.

2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.

Standardized categorical variables and date formats.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate and bivariate analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Derived insights about patterns, trends, and correlations.

4. SQL Analysis

Imported the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Wrote and executed SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

Top-performing categories

Monthly/quarterly trends

Customer segmentation

Optimized queries for performance.

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to the SQL database.

Designed an interactive dashboard with key KPIs, filters, and visuals.

Published and shared insights through a Power BI Report.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Summarized findings and recommendations.

Created an AI-powered Gamma presentation to highlight key insights, visualizations, and business takeaways.
